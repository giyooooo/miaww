                <div class="message-text">
                    I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. You've been my calm in the mess, my strength when I've been weak, and the softness I didn't know I needed.

Through the highs and the hard parts, through moments we didn't understand each other, and times when everything felt unsure ‚Äî you've still been the one my heart chooses. Not because things are perfect, but because loving you feels real, grounding, and worth it every time.

Even when we've hurt, even when the world felt too heavy for us, you've stayed in my heart. I know I haven't always loved you the right way ‚Äî especially when it was hard. But please know this: I never stopped choosing you. I'm still learning how to love you better, how to hold you in the dark. And I will keep trying, because you matter that much to me.

You're the girl I failed but never stopped choosing.
You're the girl whose heart I hurt, but whose presence I still want to earn back every day.
You're the girl I love‚Äîno one and nothing else in between.

Thank you for staying, for loving, for believing‚Äîeven when it's hard. I see you; I value you, and I love you more than I can ever fully say.

I will keep showing up. For you. For us. In each passing day.

Because it's you. Always has been.
